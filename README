# Development

## Chrashes

The code is driven by events. These events are blocking. That is, the
main WoW event loop blocks when any of the registered events are fired.
If the main event loop is blocked too long the entire app will crash
(likely, a watchdog timer kills it).
    
Do what we need to when an event is fired, but do it as quickly as
possible. Also, try to execute off of the main event thread (in timed
callbacks) as much as possible.

## Debugging

`/console scriptErrors 1`
